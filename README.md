# EGBE601 - Final Project: ECG Categorization
This GitHub repository contains the final project for the EGBE601 Signal Processing. The project focuses on the categorization of ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals using a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which is a preprocessed dataset derived from the MIT-BIH ECG data.

## Dataset
The ECG Categorization Dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat/data). It is preprocessed and derived from the MIT-BIH ECG data.

## Project Structure
The project code is organized into two main sections:

### 1. ECG Preprocessing
This section involves data exploratory analysis and signal processing techniques such as moving average and Butterworth low-pass filter to prepare the ECG signals for classification.

### 2. ECG Classification Model
In this section, the processed ECG signals are used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classification. The steps involved are:

#### Data Preparation: 
Including train-test split and normalization of the data.

#### CNN Modeling: 
- Designing the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network.
- Training the CNN model on the preprocessed ECG data.
- Evaluating the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics.
